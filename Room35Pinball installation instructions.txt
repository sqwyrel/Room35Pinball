Room35Pinball installation instructions

Install python 3.12.10 (64-bit) from python.org
    Select Add python.exe to PATH when installing
Download latest version of Godot from Godot from godotengine.org
    Godot is a stand alone executable program and does not need to be installed.
Install Visual Studio Code with default installation options
Install GitHub Desktop app
Create a folder called Room35Pinball in the Documents folder which will be the root directory of the project
Clone the repository at https://github.com/sqwyrel/Room35Pinball.git to this root directory
    This repository contains all config files for MPF and Godot
Create a python virtual environment to install and run MPF
    Open a user PowerShell (PS C:\Users\Username>) and enter python -m venv mpfvenv
    This creates a python virtual environment named mpfvenv
    This only needs to be done once
In order to be able to run scripts to activate the virtual environment, you need to do the following:
    Open PowerShell as administrator (PS C:\WINDOWS\System32>) and enter Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
    This only needs to be done once
To activate the MPV virtual environment
    Open a user PowerShell (PS C:\Users\Username>)
    Enter mpfvenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    You will know that the virtual environment is active because it will add (mpfvenv) at the head of the prompt
        (mpfvenv) PS C:\Users\Username>
Install MPF within the virtual environment
    You must be within the mpfvenv virtual environment in PowerShell to do this
    Enter pip install mpf --pre 
    The --pre command will install the latest version of mpf (which should be Mission Pinball Framework v0.80.0.dev11)
To initialise MPF (not sure if you need to do this since the clone repository should have all of the necessary files)
    Open a user PowerShell
    Activate the mpfvenv
    To verify the python version enter python --version
    To verify the MPF version enter mpf --version
    Go to the project directory which might be (mpfvenv) PS D:\Documents\Room35Pinball> 
    Enter mpf init
    You only need to do this once
To run MPF without the Godot media controller
    Open a user PowerShell
    Activate the mpfvenv
    Enter mpf -xtb
To import the project into Godot
    Open Godot
    Select Import project
    Select the root directory
    The project should open up with all of the existing configs including .gitignore and .gitattributes
Any changes to the root directory should be committed and pushed to Git with the Git Desktop app
